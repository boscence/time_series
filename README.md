FORECASTING TIME SERIES
Sessions 10 and 11
(By Lorenzo Pascual Caneiro for MBD at IE Business School, February 2016)
For the last two sessions students have to model four real time series data following the methodology proposed by Box and Jenkins.
For each time series, students have to find, and rigorously justify following all the steps shown in class, the model or models that best fit each data set. Finally, using the selected models students have to predict future values for the variables of interest and compute confidence intervals; remember that point predictions and confidence intervals have to be obtained for the variables in the original scale.
All groups have to analyze the four time series data. Each group must send before midnight on February 18, a Word document explaining in detail the steps followed to find the model, or models that best fit each data set. It is not allowed to use more than 4 pages per time series.
In addition, each group will prepare a “ppt” document that will be presented to the rest of the class during 10 minutes. During this time, the groups will explain in detail all the steps followed to find the best model for one of the time series data; see below.
During the presentation, the teacher will ask questions about the Box-Jenkins methodology to any team member. The group final grade will depend on the performance of all members.
The four time series data to be analyzed are:
Series 1. Daily returns to Microsoft. The excel file Series1.xls has two series (columns). The first one represents the original Daily Returns (close price) and the second one represents a smooth version of the Daily Returns (3-day moving average smoothed price). Find the best model for both data set, forecast future values and compute confidence intervals. How many steps/horizons do the forecasted values need to converge to the unconditional mean? For the final model check also if the residuals are SWN and/or GWN. The study for this data set has to be presented during the class by Groups A and H separately.

Series 2. Monthly data for U.S. Unemployed looking for part-time work; see excel file Series2.xls. Find the best model for both data set, forecast future values and compute confidence intervals. For the final model check also if the residuals are SWN and/or GWN. The study for this data set has to be presented during the class by Groups B and G separately.
Series 3. Monthly clothing sales in the United States; see excel file Series3.xls. Find the best model for both data set, forecast future values and compute confidence intervals. For the final model check also if the residuals are SWN and/or GWN. The analysis for time series has to be presented by Groups C and F separately.
Series 4. Daily Brent Dated spot prices; see excel file Series4.xls. Find the best model for both daily spot prices and daily log returns and forecast both time series. For each final model check also if the residuals are SWN and/or GWN. This analysis has to be presented by Groups D and E separately.
